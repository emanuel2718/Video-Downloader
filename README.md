# Video-Downloader

The idea of this project is for it to be the goto place to get videos/photos
from different social media platforms.

## Platforms
- [x] Facebook (Need to refactor and format)
- [ ] YouTube
- [ ] Instagram
- [ ] Twitter
- [ ] TikTok

# TODO LIST:
- [ ] Add at least 3/5 of the platforms from the menu.
- [ ] Check connection before requests.
- [ ] Default into HD; if not available use SD (Maybe ask user for format).
- [ ] Check validity of url.
- [ ] Refactor function calling for the different platforms.
- [ ] Format to: "Save as: {filename}.mp4"
- [ ] Add all the platforms from the menu.
